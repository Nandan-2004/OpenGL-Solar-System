# OpenGL Solar System

An interactive 3D simulation of the solar system created using OpenGL. The program visualizes planetary orbits, rotations, and hierarchical transformations to demonstrate key concepts of computer graphics.

## Features

- Rotating planets and a moon with accurate hierarchical modeling.
- Realistic animations for orbital and rotational motion.
- Utilizes FreeGLUT for windowing and OpenGL rendering.

## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio** or another C++ development environment.
- **OpenGL Libraries** (FreeGLUT, OpenGL Utility Toolkit).

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenGL-Solar-System.git
   cd OpenGL-Solar-System
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Configure project dependencies:
   - Add the FreeGLUT `include` and `lib` directories to the project's settings.
   - Link the following libraries: `opengl32.lib`, `glu32.lib`, `freeglut.lib`.

4. Build and run the project.

## Usage

- Observe the solar system's planetary motion.
- Customize planetary parameters to explore different orbital behaviors.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a basic introduction to 3D computer graphics, allowing users to visualize a simplified model of our solar system. The solar system simulation can be expanded to include additional features, such as:

Real-time control of camera positions.
Interactive exploration of each planetâ€™s characteristics.
More realistic lighting and textures for the planets and stars.
